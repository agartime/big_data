1. Help! 2 1 Help!
(Lennon/McCartney)
Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody’s help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I’m not so self assured,
Now I find I’ve changed my mind and opened up the doors.
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down And I do appreciate you being round. Help me, get my feet back on the ground, Won’t you please, please help me.
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways, My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I’ve never done before.
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down And I do appreciate you being round. Help me, get my feet back on the ground, Won’t you please, please help me.
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
￼
2. TheNightBefore 3
I never needed anybody’s help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I’m not so self assured,
Now I find I’ve changed my mind and opened up the doors.
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won’t you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh.
2 The Night Before
(Lennon/McCartney)
We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before. Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before. Now today I find you have changed your mind. Treat me like you did the night before.
Were you telling lies, ah, the night before? Was I so unwise, ah, the night before? When I held you near you were so sincere. Treat me like you did the night before.
Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.
We said our goodbye, ah, the night before. Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
￼
3. You’veGottoHideYourLoveAway 4 Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.
When I held you near you were so sincere. Treat me like you did the night before.
Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.
Were you telling lies, ah, the night before? Was I so unwise, ah, the night before? When I held you near you were so sincere. Treat me like you did the night before, like the night before.
3 You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away

4. INeedYou
Hey you’ve got to hide your Hey you’ve got to hide your
How could I even try

Gather round all you clowns Let me hear you say
Hey you’ve got to hide your Hey you’ve got to hide your
4 I Need You
(Harrison)
You don’t realize how much
And never leave you.
Please come on back to me. I’m lonely as can be. I need you.

You told me, oh yes, you told me, you don’t want my lovin’ anymore.

They’re gonna put me in the movies
They’re gonna make a big star out of me
We’ll make a film about a man that’s sad and lonely And all I gotta so is act naturally
Well, I’ll bet you I’m gonna be a big star Might win an Oscar you can never tell The movies gonna make me a big star ’Cause I can plat the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We’ll make the scene about a man that’s sad and lonely And beggin’ down upon his bended knee
I’ll play the part but I won’t need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I’ll bet you I’m gonna be a big star

9 It’s Only Love
(Lennon/McCartney)
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies, Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I’m beside you? It’s only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It’s only love, and that is all,
But it’s so hard loving you.
Is it right that you and I should fight
Ev’ry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, Very bright.
Haven’t I the right to make it up girl?
It’s only love and that is all,

Telling me there’ll be no next time
If I don’t just don’t treat you right,
You’ll never leave me and you know it’s true, ’cause you like me too much and I like you.
You’ve tried before to leave me, But you haven’t got the nerve To walk out and make me lonely Which is all that I deserve,
You’ll never leave me and you know it’s true, ’cause you like me too much and I like you.

Me back again.

And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go I don’t know she wouldn’t say. I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play. Now I need a place to hide away.

In case of accidents he always took his mom
He’s the all American bullet-headed Saxon mother’s son. All the children sing
Hey Bungalow Bill What did you kill Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill What did you kill Bungalow Bill?

Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill What did you kill Bungalow Bill?

20. WhileMyGuitarGentlyWeeps 24 20 While My Guitar Gently Weeps
(Harrison)
I look at you all see the love there that’s sleeping While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping Still my guitar gently weeps
I don’t know why nobody told you how to unfold your love I don’t know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.
I look at the world and I notice it’s turning While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps
I don’t know how you were diverted You were perverted too
I don’t know how you were inverted No one alerted you.
I look at you all see the love there that’s sleeping While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all...
Still my guitar gently weeps.

21. HappinessisaWarmGun 25 21 Happiness is a Warm Gun
(Lennon/McCartney)
She’s not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do
She’s well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand Like a lizard on a window pane.
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors On his hobnailed boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate And donated to the Nation Trust.
I need a fix ’cause I’m going down Down to the bits that I left uptown I need a fix cause I’m going down Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun.
Happiness is a warm gun Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger I know no one can do me no harm
￼
22. MarthaMyDear 26 Because happiness is a warm gun
-Yes it is.
22 Martha My Dear
(Lennon/McCartney)
Martha my dear though I spend my days in conversation Please
Remember me Martha my love

Hold your head up you silly girl look what you’ve done When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly Girl.
Take a good look around you
Take a good look you’re bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other Silly girl.
Hold your hand out you silly girl see what you’ve done When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl.
￼
22. MarthaMyDear 27
Martha my dear you have always been my inspiration Please

Don’t forget me Martha my dear.
I’m so tired
(Lennon/McCartney)
I’m so tired, I haven’t slept a wink
I’m so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink No,no,no.
I’m so tired I don’t know what to do
I’m so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you’d do
You’d say I’m putting you on
But it’s no joke, it’s doing me harm
You know I can’t sleep, I can’t stop my brain You know it’s three weeks, I’m going insane You know I’d give you everything I’ve got for a little peace of mind
I’m so tired, I’m feeling so upset
Although I’m so tired I’ll have another cigarette And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get.

24. Piggies 29 24 Piggies
(Harrison)
Have you seen the little piggies Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.
Have you seen the bigger piggies In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.
In their styes with all their backing
They don’t care what goes on around
In their eyes there’s something lacking What they need’s a damn good whacking.
Everywhere there’s lots of piggies Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

25. RockyRaccoon 30 25 Rocky Raccoon
(Lennon/McCartney)
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn’t like that
He said I’m gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room Only to find Gideon’s bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
￼
26. Don’tPassMeBy 31 And Rocky said, Doc it’s only a scratch
And I’ll be better I’ll be better doc as soon as I am able.
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room Only to find Gideon’s bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt To help with good Rocky’s revival.
26 Don’t Pass Me By
(Starkey)
I listen for your footsteps Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps But they don’t arrive Waiting for your knock dear On my old front door
I don’t hear it
Does it mean you don’t love me any more.
I hear the clock a’ticking On the mantel shelf
See the hands a’moving But I’m by myself
I wonder where you are tonight And why I’m by myself
I don’t see you
￼
26. Don’tPassMeBy 32 Does it mean you don’t love me any more.
Don’t pass me by don’t make me cry don’t make me blue ’Cause you know darling I love only you
You’ll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don’t pass me by don’t make me cry
I’m sorry that I doubted you I was so unfair
You were in a car crash And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that’s all right I’m waiting here Just waiting to hear from you.
Why Don’t We Do It In The Road? (Lennon/McCartney)

I didn’t catch your name But it never really mattered I will always feel the same.
Love you forever and forever Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we’re together Love you when we’re apart.
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me You know I will
I will.

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering, In the sun
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me So I sing a song of love, Julia
When I cannot sing my heart

Ooh girl you know the reason why.
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth But I am of the universe
And you know what it’s worth I’m lonely wanna die
If I ain’t dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan’s Mr. Jones
Lonely wanna die
If I ain’t dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.

If I ain’t dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.
31 Mother Nature’s Son
(Lennon/McCartney)
Born a poor young country boy–Mother Nature’s son All day long I’m sitting singing songs for everyone.
Sit beside a mountain stream–see her waters rise Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.
Find me in my field of grass–Mother Nature’s son Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.
Mother Nature’s son.

She was a working girl North of England way Now she’s hit the big time In the USA
And if she could only hear me This is what I’d say.

So won’t you please come home.
Oh honey pie my position is tragic Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen And now the thought of meeting you Makes me weak in the knee.
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Kindly send her sailing back to me.
Honey pie you are making me crazy I’m in love but I’m lazy
So won’t you please come home.

Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert–yes you know it’s good news But you’ll have to have them all pulled out After the Savoy truffle.
￼
38. Savoy Truffle 46
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we’re apart Coconut fudge–really blows down those blues But you’ll have to have them all pulled out After the Savoy truffle.
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through You’re going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head When it becomes too much
You’re going to shout aloud –Creme tangerine.
You know that what you eat you are, But what is sweet now, turns so sour– We all know Obla-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?..
Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert–yes you know its good news But you’ll have to have them all pulled out After the Savoy truffle.
